# Submarine-Game
Group project - submarine game where the submarine fights waves to try to survive.
Each level difficulty increases.
Built a UI system where the user can select what to execute from the different options.
It has keyboard and mouse inputs to allow the user to navigate the game.
My group and I never got to finish the game.
